      - Negative impact on customer satisfaction
    alternatives: &id031
      other_options:
      - Outsourcing logging to a third-party service
      - Using a cloud-based logging solution
      - Maintaining the status quo
      why_this_solution: Centralizing and standardizing logging within SPECTRA provides
        better control, security, and scalability compared to outsourcing or using
        a third-party solution
    validation: &id032
      solution_solves_problem: Yes, a centralized logging service addresses the issue
        of decentralized and inconsistent logging across SPECTRA services.
      confidence: High
      assumptions:
      - Assuming that the chosen logging solution is compatible with existing SPECTRA
        services
      - Assuming that the budget and timeline are sufficient for successful implementation
