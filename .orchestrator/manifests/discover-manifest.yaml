  service_name: logging
  problem:
    description: Decentralized and inconsistent logging across SPECTRA services, making
      it difficult to analyze application logs, leading to inefficiencies in troubleshooting,
      monitoring, and auditing.
    impact: Increased time and effort required to identify and resolve issues, reduced
      visibility into system performance, and potential compliance issues due to lack
      of proper logging.
  current_state:
    description: Currently, each SPECTRA service has its own logging implementation,
      resulting in a fragmented logging infrastructure.
    pain_points:
    - Inconsistent logging formats
    - Difficulty in centralizing logs
    - Lack of real-time analysis capabilities
    gaps:
    - Missing centralized logging repository
    - Lack of standardized logging practices
  desired_state:
    vision: A unified logging service that centralizes and standardizes logging across
      all SPECTRA services.
    success_criteria:
    - Reduced time to resolve issues
    - Improved visibility into system performance
    - Easier compliance with logging standards
    goals:
    - Centralized logging repository
    - Standardized logging formats
    - Real-time analysis capabilities

  constraints:
    technical:
    - Compatibility with existing SPECTRA services
    - Scalability requirements
    - Security and privacy concerns
    business:
    - Budget constraints
    - Timeline for implementation
    - Impact on ongoing projects
    time: 4-6 months for development and deployment
    budget: Up to $100,000
    compliance: Must comply with relevant logging standards (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
  requirements:
    functional:
    - Centralized logging repository
    - Real-time log analysis
    - Log aggregation and search capabilities
    - Log retention and archiving
    non-functional:
    - High availability
    - Scalability
    - Security and privacy
    - User-friendly interface
  risks:
    technical:
    - Integration issues with existing SPECTRA services
    - Performance bottlenecks
    - Data breaches or leaks
    business:
    - Delayed implementation
    - Exceeding budget
    - Negative impact on customer satisfaction
  alternatives:
    other_options:
    - Outsourcing logging to a third-party service
    - Using a cloud-based logging solution
    - Maintaining the status quo
    why_this_solution: Centralizing and standardizing logging within SPECTRA provides
      better control, security, and scalability compared to outsourcing or using a
      third-party solution
  idea: {}
  validation:
    solution_solves_problem: Yes, a centralized logging service addresses the issue
      of decentralized and inconsistent logging across SPECTRA services.
    confidence: High
    assumptions:
    - Assuming that the chosen logging solution is compatible with existing SPECTRA
      services
    - Assuming that the budget and timeline are sufficient for successful implementation
  recommended_tools:
  - discovery_game
  - extract_design
  - generate_documents
  next_steps: 1. Run the discovery_game to gather more detailed requirements and architecture
    considerations. 2. Infer the architecture and technology stack using extract_design.
    3. Create problem statement and proposed approach documents using generate_documents.
